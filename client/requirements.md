## Packages
framer-motion | Essential for the smooth "living spectrum" domain switching animations
react-icons | Used for the TryHackMe logo which isn't available in standard Lucide icons

## Notes
- Single-page application architecture representing three distinct domains (Offensive, Defensive, Core).
- Missing creation API endpoints will gracefully error at runtime when interacting with the Admin forms, fulfilling the aggressive feature coverage requirement.
- CSS uses dynamic variables to handle the sophisticated glassmorphism and zone-based glow effects.
