You are tasked with designing a single-page, fully interactive cybersecurity portfolio for Adel Ait Mouali, a Network Specialist with hands-on experience across offensive security, defensive security, infrastructure, scripting, IoT, and applied machine learning. The portfolio must not resemble a traditional multi-page CV or menu-based website; instead, it should feel like a living system that dynamically reveals skills and capabilities based on cursor interaction.

Core Concept

The portfolio represents Adel’s skillset as an interactive spectrum between offense and defense:

Red Zone – Offensive Security / Hacking Skills
Hovering over this area transforms the interface to display all offensive skills and experiences dynamically. Backgrounds, accents, and panels adopt red/orange tones. Skills include:

Linux 101, privilege awareness

Web hacking, API testing, bug bounty workflows

Practical exploitation knowledge

Hands-on use of security tools and pentesting toolkits

Request manipulation, authentication/authorization testing

TryHackMe room completions (Log Analysis, Hash Cracking, Burp Suite, Pentester Tools)

Blue Zone – Defensive Security / Protection Skills
Hovering here transitions the page to a blue defensive environment. Skills appear framed as monitoring, hardening, or protection:

Firewall configuration (FortiGate, UFW)

VPN setup and network segmentation

Log analysis and traffic monitoring (Wireshark)

Systems hardening, directory services, group policies

Security operations workflow experience

Neutral / Core Zone – Foundational & Applied Tech
Hovering here shows foundational technical competencies across infrastructure, programming, automation, IoT, and applied ML:

Network architecture: Switching, Routing, VLANs, TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP

Systems: Linux, Windows Server, virtualization (VirtualBox, Docker)

Scripting: Python (applied for automation, data analysis, visualization), Bash/Shell

Productivity platforms: Office 365

IoT and embedded systems: Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, sensors, actuators

Applied ML and computer vision: YOLOv6, YOLOv8, model training and deployment

Automation projects: environmental monitoring alerts via Telegram/SMS/Gmail

All skills must be realistic, practice-oriented, and evidence-based, reflecting hands-on exposure rather than formal certifications or course titles.

Interaction & Dynamics

The cursor position drives the entire page state. Hovering over red/blue zones morphs all content, layout, and color accents, emphasizing offensive or defensive context.

Minimal, professional, functional animations: cards slide, details fade in/out, skills reposition smoothly; animation should highlight content meaning, not decorate.

Skills are contextually reframed: the same competency appears differently depending on perspective. For example:

Linux in Red → attack, enumeration, privilege escalation awareness

Linux in Blue → monitoring, hardening, secure configuration

No menus, no buttons, no page navigation; exploration is natural and intuitive.

Design System

Dark professional aesthetic with zone-based color accents: red/orange for offensive, blue for defensive, cyan for neutral.

Responsive flexbox or grid layouts suitable for desktop and mobile.

Interactive skill cards, project showcases, and dynamic panels.

Social links subtly integrated: TryHackMe, GitHub, LinkedIn.

Data Architecture

TypeScript or JSON-based skill/project data model with attributes:

Skill Name, Domain (Offense/Defense/Neutral), Category (Networking, Scripting, IoT, ML), Practical Exposure Level, Related Projects

Projects include 3–5 featured items demonstrating application of skills across the spectrum

Identity & Branding

Name: Adel Ait Mouali

Role: Network Specialist

Portfolio tagline: “Explore the living spectrum: offense, defense, and core technology — skills revealed as you interact.”

The portfolio must convey systems thinking, practical mastery, and professional maturity. It should feel alive, intelligent, and cohesive, giving viewers an immediate sense of expertise and hands-on experience without traditional CV elements.
